# Cenerion

Cenerion was built using JavaScript Es5 & Es6, Jquery, Axios, and the omdbApi.

As you inspect, you will see there is not a lot of complex code here, but the integration is seem-less. Built for simplicity, I feel this website achieves just that. Providing the client with direct access to information without the clutter and eyesore most movie databases provide.

I hope that enjoy your time using this app.
